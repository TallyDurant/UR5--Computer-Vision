Object Detection and Color Segmentation for UR-5 Robot Arm

This project involves developing a system for object detection and color segmentation to allow the UR-5 robot arm to grab objects and drop them into appropriate buckets.

Description
The UR-5 robot arm is a versatile robotic arm used in various applications, including industrial automation and research. In this project, we aim to develop a system that will allow the UR-5 robot arm to detect and grab objects and drop them into appropriate buckets based on their color.

The project will involve developing computer vision algorithms for object detection and color segmentation. We will use deep learning techniques to train a model that can detect and recognize different objects. We will also develop a control system that will translate the recognized objects and their colors into commands that can control the movement of the UR-5 robot arm.

The project will be divided into two parts: object detection and color segmentation. In the object detection part, we will use a convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect objects. We will train the CNN using a dataset of labeled images. In the color segmentation part, we will segment the objects based on their color using the K-means clustering algorithm.
